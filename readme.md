# House Price Prediction with RandomForest and Advanced Feature Engineering

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using advanced machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training a RandomForest model. The dataset consists of various features that describe house properties, which are used to predict the target variable, `SalePrice`.

## Workflow

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Loading and Exploring the Dataset**: Load the training and test datasets and explore their structure.
2. **Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values**: Implement strategies to fill in missing values and remove columns with excessive missing data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Apply targeted imputation for specific columns, engineer new features, and encode categorical variables.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory analysis to identify important features for predicting `SalePrice`.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train a RandomForest model, tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV, and evaluate performance using metrics such as RMSE.
6. **Visualizing Results**: Compare actual and predicted prices and analyze residuals to assess model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Libraries used for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library used for model building, feature selection, and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Libraries used for data visualization and plotting results.

## Project Highlights

- **Advanced Data Imputation**: Missing values are filled using targeted imputation techniques based on the correlation of features with `SalePrice`. For example, `LotFrontage` is imputed based on the median of its neighborhood, and `GarageYrBlt` is set to 0 if no garage is present.
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding, and features with low cardinality are converted to numerical formats.
- **Feature Selection**: Features with a high correlation with `SalePrice` are selected for model training.
- **RandomForest Model with Tuning**: A RandomForest model is trained with hyperparameter tuning through GridSearchCV, resulting in improved model performance.
- **Evaluation and Visualization**: The model is evaluated with metrics such as RMSE, cross-validation scores, and residual plots to assess performance.
